<h1>Week 4 - Activity 2: Spotify Profile Creation</h1>
<h3>The profile module checks that usernames have at least 3 characters and emails match the correct format. If the email is invalid, it won’t be saved and the input field will shake as feedback. Profile info (username, email, avatar, background) is saved in AsyncStorage and automatically reloaded with useFocusEffect, so the profile preview always shows the latest data without needing a refresh. Smooth theme changes are handled with react-native-reanimated for a better user experience.</h3>

<h1>September 23, 2025 [WEEK 5] - Change Themes (Dark/Light Mode)</h1>
<h3>This activity lets users switch between dark and light themes. The chosen theme is saved, so it stays the same even after closing and reopening the app, and it is applied across all screens. NOTE: Screens are made originally/initially in dark mode hehe</h3>
<img width="358" height="727" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ee85e44-62e2-4938-bc0e-40eba554d47f" /> <img width="357" height="728" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af52e489-1894-42c1-a513-10c2d2925bdf" /> 
<img width="387" height="797" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c452fc3f-d2d5-45b4-b10d-044b9f432bf3" /> <img width="393" height="798" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30c0efea-00c3-46a7-8f6f-525e76bc9cbc" />

<h3>The app uses a dynamic theming system powered by React Navigation’s useTheme() hook and Redux to manage light and dark modes. All screens such as Profile, Playlist, and Playlist Detail automatically update their backgrounds, text, buttons, and borders based on the active theme. With the theme stored globally, any change instantly applies throughout the entire app. This setup ensures a cohesive user experience and makes it simple to introduce additional custom themes later on.</h3>


<h1>September 25, 2025 [WEEK 5] - Camera</h1>
<h3>This activity lets users take a photo with the camera or select one from the gallery and set it as their profile picture. The image is stored using AsyncStorage, ensuring that changes remain saved even after the app is closed and reopened.</h3>
<img width="354" height="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1765abfb-5dc5-4d9c-8468-04f4b2302f7f" /> <img width="355" height="804" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6a84148-5ecd-4248-b2c5-46e40d394e12" /> <img width="355" height="804" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9659fd4f-8cfa-4e84-9953-9dd19dab8fcd" /> <img width="350" height="725" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceeb5561-9dee-453e-bfe5-2ba6015f4ae8" />

<h3>NEW SAVED PROFILE PHOTO</h3>
<img width="357" height="726" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1137b59d-09ee-4079-8576-142e509260f6" />

<h1>Access camera using my phone</h1>
<img width="286" height="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dcde8c7-2b3c-4a7f-9aa0-4cdd02e54817" />

<h2>---with filters and tools (rotate and crop)</h2>
<img width="289" height="637" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b5cb66-241d-49f4-be6d-fcc795ba8047" /> <img width="291" height="654" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/101fc3f3-1b56-47b2-a9bf-16d932adf7f3" />

<h3>The camera feature lets me take photos and save them directly to a gallery. After capturing an image, I can apply filters such as grayscale or sepia and fine-tune their intensity with a slider, as well as rotate and crop the photo before saving. This makes it easy to edit and manage images within the app itself. I initially had issues with the intensity slider working only on the web, but I was able to fix it—yey!</h3>

<h1>WEEK 6: ACTIVITY 1</h1>
<h2>Running app on ios! Success!</h2>
<img width="419" height="863" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/471cef0c-396a-4b19-9df6-7a8dd374dce9" /> <img width="1170" height="2532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eba0d8d9-5a07-406d-9ecb-8a74ec4324b8" />

<h1>MAP FEATUREEE</h1>

<H3>The map features allow users to view their current location, search for specific places, and interact with markers for additional information. The implementation also includes smooth zooming and panning for better navigation. One of the main challenges faced was handling location permissions and ensuring accurate real-time positioning. Integrating the map API and managing asynchronous loading also required careful debugging to avoid crashes or blank map displays.</H3>




-----------------That is all! Thank you so muchhh <3 I had fun making this yey------------------
