<h1>Week 4 - Activity 2: Spotify Profile Creation</h1>
<h3>The profile module checks that usernames have at least 3 characters and emails match the correct format. If the email is invalid, it wonâ€™t be saved and the input field will shake as feedback. Profile info (username, email, avatar, background) is saved in AsyncStorage and automatically reloaded with useFocusEffect, so the profile preview always shows the latest data without needing a refresh. Smooth theme changes are handled with react-native-reanimated for a better user experience.</h3>

<h1>September 23, 2025 [WEEK 5] - Change Themes (Dark/Light Mode)</h1>
<h3>This activity lets users switch between dark and light themes. The chosen theme is saved, so it stays the same even after closing and reopening the app, and it is applied across all screens. NOTE: Screens are made originally/initially in dark mode hehe</h3>

<h1>September 25, 2025 [WEEK 5] - Camera</h1>
